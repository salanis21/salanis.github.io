                Film Producer, Director, Screenwriter</p> 
                 <p class="text-white"> As a film producer I want to direct myself specifically to autobiographical documentaries. My motives as a film producer is to achieve knowledge and show my creative, and innovative ideas through my projects. My work includes my skills as a director, screenwriter, editor, and producer. While interning at Warner Brothers Studios I worked along-side producers, shadowing them. This allowed my knowledge about filmmaking to expand. I expect my projects will showcase my skills as a filmmaker.

<h3 class="h3 mt-3">A Student’s Story of Resistance and Existence</h3>
          <h2 class="text-white" font-weight="normal">During this short documentary the audience gets a glimpse into an undocumented student’s everyday schedule. We are able to see the student’s struggles, and her determination to finish her studies. Being a part of this project as a stand in actor, and editor allowed me to step into the post-production elements. During editing we work with all the footage we collected, and piece it together or cut scenes out. </h2>

            <h4 class="h4" font-weight="bold">Youth Abuse in Baja California Rehabilitation Center 
                <p class="text-white" font-weight="light">This project is a documentary proposal focused on Baja California rehab facilities, and the cruel treatment between patients. It covers how this film will be made. These are the documents that provide the steps of proposing a pitch, and turning it into a film. In addition, there will also be a description of the budget, and a breakdown of the shooting schedule. This project emphasized my production role, overlooking the departments, and the film's progress. </p> </h4>

                Jordie
                <p class="text-white" font-weight="bold">Choose Your Destiny, Flip the Coin
                    <p class="text-white" font-weight="light">The script is a feature long film about Jordie, and Cole, two beings that are tied by time travel. There is a development of the characters, through plenty of dream and flashback sequences. Their love for eachother ends up being in limbo because Cole suffers from a deteriorating hippocampus. Throughout the story we see Cole’s perspective towards Jordie and vice versa. This ultimately leads to the character's old age and Cole’s goodbye to Jordie. </p>

                <p class="text-white" font-weight="bold">Romeo and Juliet on a Budget
                    <p class="text-white" font-weight="light">This was a very creative project working with other students in Youth Programs in East Los Angeles. It was a short film showing the dangers of piracy. I was able to participate as an actor, and crew member. It was an eye opening topic about the industry that sometimes we forget about. This short project included many hard working youth and those that have aspiring filmmaking dreams. </p>
